## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was our 2nd Milestone for our final project in CS350. The goal of this project was to create code that communicates with the TiLaunchBoard, and turns the LEDs on / off when certain keys are pressed. 

## What did you do particularly well?
This was the point in the course where the concepts started to "click" for me. I was able to develop the code to accomplish the requirements of the project, while maintaining readable and organized code. 

## Where could you improve?
I need to go back and change the code so the LEDs change when you press 'O' and 'N', or 'O', 'F', and 'F', where I have mine as '1' and '0.' 

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The project was developed in Code Composer Studio, and the tools I integrated include DMA, GPIO, and UART2. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The organization of my code with the frequent commenting are approaches that will carry over in further projects and assignments. 

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I seperated all the necessary piece of code, and have comments to describe what each piece was doing.
