## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was my final project for CS350. I was tasked to creating a prototype of a handheld thermostat that can read the temperature of a room, and adjust the LEDs on the TiLaunchBoard depending on the temperature read by the sensors. 

## What did you do particularly well?
Going into this project the objectives and requirements felt overwhelming. Building this device to operate as expected required several pieces to work together, and I feel as though I built my code properly and well enough to accomplish this, as the device worked as intended.

## Where could you improve?
My code could've used more and frequent commenting to let the user know what each piece of code was doing. 

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The project was built using Code Composer Studio, and the tools I used included GPIO, I2C, Timer, and UART. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project was one of the most elaborate projects I've worked on in my CS program. I had to break the project down into smaller parts, and made sure I had a plan going into development. These are approaches I can take into future projects. 

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Since this project required multiple tools to be integrated, I made sure to seperate all of the different tools and the pieces of code associated with them, so the .c file would be easily readable for other developers.
